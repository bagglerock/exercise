# Create React app exercise

### yarn install to install, yarn start to start

##Problem:

### make a 10 x 10 grid table that has infected and non infected members. If a non infected member is surrounded by 3 or more infected... member will be infected. Otherwise it stays uninfected. Should be vice versa but forgot to implement that.
